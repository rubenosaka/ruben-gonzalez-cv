# Now

At this stage of my career I am highly motivated to work on projects that leverage **AI technologies and prompt engineering workflows**, where I can combine technical leadership with a strong connection to product and business goals. I enjoy leading and managing teams, ensuring high-quality delivery while staying close to product vision and user value.

The technologies that currently capture my interest are **Python, Vue 3, MongoDB, Astro**, and modern frameworks that enhance developer experience. I am particularly excited about exploring **Bun.js** and other cutting-edge tools that are shaping the future of web development. I strive to keep a balance between leading teams and staying hands-on, continuously experimenting with new frameworks and methodologies to remain at the forefront of modern software engineering.

In parallel, I am close to finishing **Trinuki**, my personal project that uses **OpenAI-powered AI** to generate customized travel itineraries for Japan. Trinuki combines my passion for Japanese culture with my technical expertise in architecture and AI, and represents the kind of innovative, user-focused product I love to create.
