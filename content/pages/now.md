## Currently Working On

### Portfolio Website

I'm building this portfolio website using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and clean architecture principles. The goal is to showcase my work while demonstrating my commitment to writing maintainable, well-structured code.

**Technologies**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Contentlayer, shadcn/ui

### Open Source Contributions

I'm actively contributing to several open source projects, focusing on developer tools and libraries that improve the developer experience.

**Projects**: React ecosystem, TypeScript utilities, developer tooling

### Technical Writing

I'm writing blog posts and technical articles about software architecture, clean code practices, and modern web development techniques.

**Topics**: Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID principles, React patterns

## Learning & Exploring

### Advanced TypeScript

I'm deepening my knowledge of TypeScript's advanced features, including conditional types, mapped types, and utility types.

**Focus**: Type safety, generic constraints, advanced patterns

### System Design

I'm studying system design principles and patterns to better understand how to build scalable, distributed systems.

**Areas**: Microservices, event-driven architecture, data modeling

### Performance Optimization

I'm exploring techniques for optimizing web application performance, from frontend rendering to backend database queries.

**Techniques**: Code splitting, lazy loading, caching strategies

## Personal Development

### Reading

Currently reading "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin and "Domain-Driven Design" by Eric Evans to strengthen my architectural thinking.

### Fitness

Maintaining a regular exercise routine with a focus on strength training and cardiovascular health.

### Mindfulness

Practicing daily meditation and mindfulness techniques to improve focus and reduce stress.
