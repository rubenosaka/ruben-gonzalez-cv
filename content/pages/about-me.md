# About Me

I am Rubén González Aranda, an Madrid based **Engineering Manager and Full-Stack Tech Lead** with more than 18 years of experience building digital products across fintech, healthcare, education, marketing, and startups. My career has been defined by a strong focus on software architecture, developer experience, agile practices, and technical leadership, balancing strategic vision with hands-on development.

I am a strong advocate of the principles in _Clean Code_, believing that well-crafted code should be self-explanatory and sustainable. For this reason, I avoid using comments whenever possible, relying on meaningful naming and clear abstractions. Development is not only my profession but also my hobby, so I enjoy testing new frameworks and experimenting with emerging technologies.

Throughout my career I have worked with both small and large teams in digital marketing agencies, consultancy firms, and two startups, which has given me a broad and multidisciplinary perspective. I have delivered solutions for industries such as advertising, banking, education, healthcare, and power electronics, which stand out as the most significant sectors in my professional background.

I particularly enjoy working closely with **product teams**, ensuring that technical decisions align with business goals and deliver real value to users.

Beyond technology, I am deeply passionate about Japanese culture and have spent years exploring the country, always discovering new cities, traditions, and landscapes. Traveling is one of my greatest joys, and I am constantly inspired by experiencing new cultures and perspectives.

I am also a big fan of music with eclectic tastes, ranging from metal and progressive rock to electronic and experimental sounds. Cinema is another of my passions, with a particular love for horror films. And when I am not coding or traveling, I share my life with two wonderful cats, Fox and Dana, who always remind me to pause and enjoy the little things.
